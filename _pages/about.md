I am currently a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in the MSML program. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in May 2025. My current research interests include machine learning compilers, efficient training and inference, parallelization schemes, and hardware-aware algorithm design. Much of my past work has related to solving problems in these areas using PyTorch and CUDA.

At GT, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Victor Fung at the [Fung Group](https://www.fung-group.org), where I broadly worked on pre-training strategies for large-scale foundation graph neural networks for applications to materials chemistry. I also briefly worked under Prof. Ye Zhao and Max Asselmeier at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu).

I interned at Millennium Management in Miami as a machine learning engineer last summer and worked on evaluating agents on text2SQL-like tasks. I have also interned at Amazon, EXL Service, M2IOT Solutions, and the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.

Outside of work, I enjoy
- Video games: I regularly play SSBU and MK8DX (I don't own a Switch 2 yet). I'm currently playing Celeste, Silksong, and Tears of the Kingdom.
- Non-video games: I especially enjoy social deduction games like Blood on the Clocktower and Ultimate Werewolf. I also like trick-taking card games like Wizard and Court Piece. 
- Hiking: I've been to a few US national parks (Acadia, Everglades, Zion, Death Valley, Biscayne, Mount Rainier). Among others, I'm hoping to visit Denali, Yosemite, and Glacier soon.
- Piano/Keyboard: I don't currently own a piano, but I have a MIDI keyboard I play occasionally.
