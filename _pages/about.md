I am an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Mathematics with concentrations in Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation. My research interests include geometric deep learning, systems for machine learning, high-throughput computational simulations, scientific machine learning, and hardware/software co-design.

At GT, I am conducting research with Prof. Victor Fung at the [Fung Group](https://www.fung-group.org), where I am broadly working on developing foundation graph neural networks for applications to materials chemistry. Until May 2024, I also worked at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu), where I investigated deep reinforcement learning approaches for decentralized multi-robot collision avoidance and navigation.

I previously interned at Amazon on the benefits team, where I developed a secure micro-frontend for using TypeScript and the AWS CDK to enable on-calls to inspect and refresh employee data caches. I migrated over 90% of legacy users and achieved a 10-fold reduction in average turnaround time. Before Amazon, I interned at EXL Service, where I developed end-to-end domain-agnostic document processing solutions and also worked on adapting techniques for few-shot learning to document image classification and custom named entity recognition. I have also worked at M2IOT Solutions, an Industrial IoT startup, as a Software Engineering Intern and at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee as a Research Intern.
