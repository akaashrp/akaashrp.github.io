I am beginning my master's degree in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University in August. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in May. My current research interests include efficient training and inference, parallelization schemes, hardware-aware algorithm design, and geometric deep learning. Much of my past work has related to solving problems in these areas using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CUDA.

At GT, I conducted research with Prof. Victor Fung at the [Fung Group](https://www.fung-group.org), where I broadly worked on pre-training strategies for large-scale foundation graph neural networks for applications to materials chemistry. Until May 2024, I also worked at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu), where I investigated deep reinforcement learning approaches for decentralized multi-robot collision avoidance and navigation.

I am interning at Millennium Management in Miami this summer. In 2024, I interned at Amazon as a software engineer on the benefits team, where I developed a secure micro-frontend using TypeScript and the AWS CDK to enable on-calls to inspect and refresh employee data caches. I migrated over 90% of legacy users and achieved a 10-fold reduction in average turnaround time. Before Amazon, I interned as a machine learning engineer at EXL Service, where I developed end-to-end document processing solutions for medical and insurance documents and worked on adapting techniques for few-shot learning to document image classification and custom named entity recognition. I have also worked at M2IOT Solutions, an Industrial IoT startup, as a software engineering intern and at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee as a research intern.
