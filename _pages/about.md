I am an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Mathematics with concentrations in Intelligence and Modeling & Simulation. My current research interests include geometric deep learning, systems for machine learning, scientific machine learning, and hardware/software co-design. Much of my past work has related to solving problems in these areas using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CUDA.

At GT, I am conducting research with Prof. Victor Fung at the [Fung Group](https://www.fung-group.org), where I am broadly working on pre-training strategies for large-scale foundation graph neural networks for applications to materials chemistry. Until May 2024, I also worked at the [Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu), where I investigated deep reinforcement learning approaches for decentralized multi-robot collision avoidance and navigation.

Last summer, I interned at Amazon as a software engineer on the benefits team, where I developed a secure micro-frontend using TypeScript and the AWS CDK to enable on-calls to inspect and refresh employee data caches. I migrated over 90% of legacy users and achieved a 10-fold reduction in average turnaround time. Before Amazon, I interned as a machine learning engineer at EXL Service, where I developed end-to-end document processing solutions for medical and insurance documents and worked on adapting techniques for few-shot learning to document image classification and custom named entity recognition. I have also worked at M2IOT Solutions, an Industrial IoT startup, as a software engineering intern and at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee as a research intern.
