excerpt: "This is the accompanying report for a group research project I worked on called \"Vasuki: Minimizing Makespan for Offline LLM Batch Inference\". The project was focused on developing a first-class offline LLM inference serving system leveraging KV cache offloading and bin-packing to navigate the induced memory-makespan-cost tradeoff space on commodity hardware."
