This is a critique I wrote for the paper "Eyeriss: An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" as part of the course "CS 8803: Hardware/Software Co-design for Machine Learning" at Georgia Tech. This critique includes a brief neutral summary, two technical strengths and weaknesses, and suggested extensions for the paper. The critique is available for download <a href="/files/critique.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
